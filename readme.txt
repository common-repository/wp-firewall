Protect WordPress from hacker attacks, spam and dangerous actions.

== Description ==

Do you like the **WP Firewall** plugin? Leave a [5 star review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-firewall/reviews/?filter=5 "Review this plugin") to recommend it to other users.

This plugin adds a set of protection rules to the .htaccess file of your WordPress site.
These rules totally protect the CMS from hacker attacks.

This is a BETA version, if you find bugs or malfunctions contact the developer from the support section.

== WP Firewall requirements ==

* Apache web server
* ModRewite
* SSL connection (https)

== WP Firewall development functions ==

This plugin uses only functions contained in the CMS core.

Do you need other functions? Ask the developer from the support section.

If after activating the protection errors or white screens occur, access the .htaccess file and remove all the code between "# BEGIN Firewall" and "# END Firewall".
